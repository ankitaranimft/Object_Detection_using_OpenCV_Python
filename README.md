#Object Detection using (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)SSD-MobileNetv3 trained on COCO Model|Implentation using PYTHON|OPENCV|Tensorflow Frozen Models
For Implementation Python is used as a programming language and for overlaying the rectangles and the Text Data OpenCV is used.

We will not train the Object Detection Classifier,rather we will be using Pretrained Deep Learning Arcchitecture based on TensorFlow.
Use OpenCv to load the already pretrained TensorFlow Frozen Models.
We will deploy the Object Detection Algorithm for:
1.Single Image
2.Video.mp4
3.Live Webcam
OBJECT DETECTION:
Based on Salient Features ,OBJECT DETECTION specifies the location of multiple objects in the image
*Classification
*Localization

ALGORITHM USED:SSD-MobileNetv3
DATASET:COCO(80 classes)

What does SSD(Single Shot MultiBox Detector ) do?
SSD divides the image into small patches and then combinesand joins those patches based on most salient features,and asks the Classifier in our project(MobileNet) to classify the image.

#Tools we need:
Install anaconda
*Package of multiple libraries and IDEs(Here we have used Jupyter Notebook)

Install these libraries(we need to install after anaconda is being installed)
-OpenCV
-pip install opencv-python![ObjectDetection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77886147/118401261-9cf15f00-b682-11eb-823d-5a3b62ede7dd.png)
